1. Add a close-confirmation mode in Settings: type `CLOSE` or double-click to confirm (both input and double-click supported).
2. After selecting a CC Switch template, creating a non-CC Switch terminal still ends up using the CC Switch configuration.
3. Style adjustments.
### Slider alignment fixes
- `ConfigSelector.vue`: fix slider alignment in the config selector
  - Use `top: 50%` + `transform: translateY(-50%)` to vertically center the thumb
  - Increase slider size (44x24px) to improve click target
  - Optimize the proportions between the track and the thumb
- `MenuBar.vue`: fix slider alignment in the Settings panel
  - Apply the same centering technique for visual consistency
### Overall comfort polish
- Modal: improve background blur (8px) and transition animation
- Buttons: add hover lift (`translateY(-1px)`) and active feedback
- Contrast: tweak opacity values for readability while keeping the dark theme
- Animations: use `ease` for all transitions
- Spacing: increase spacing to improve breathing room

4. Do not use hardlink/symlink (only copy `.claude.json` into the corresponding `claude-homes/<id>`)
  - On session start, point `USERPROFILE/HOME` to this `claude-homes/<id>` (at least for CC Switch templates)
  - Remove the “soft link switch” from UI/logic

5. Copying `.claude.json` does not include Claude Code “session/project history”; that history should only live inside a single template’s folder.
6. When copying `.claude.json`, delete all `lastSessionId` fields and ensure we write back valid JSON; also delete `projects`.
7. When initializing by copying `.claude.json`, do not keep `history.jsonl` in the profile directory.
